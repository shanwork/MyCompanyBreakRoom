                 <h4>Hi<p>Welcome to our new location!!</p></h4>
            <p>Due to increase in staff and, in any case, a need for more airy and spacious accomodation, we chose this beautifully located office space. <br /> 
                Convenient to reach by public transport, this place has a grand view of the Bay. </p>
            <p>This office space is around twice as much the earlier location, which was just enough; the projected expansion justifies the space increase</p>
            <p>As you can probably see, this is very much under construction<br/>
            One of the first rooms to get set up was the Break Room. Partly because it provides a convenient break area for the workers to have their coffee and take their meals<br />
            One cool feature we have introduced is a slot machine where you can win a beverage. Go <a href="breakRoom.html">check it out!!</a></p>
